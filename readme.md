# Flood-Extent-on-SAR-Images-Using-a-Supervised-Classifier-

Project is based on determining whether there is a ﬂood situation in the area or it is just a little overﬂow of water in the nearby river.
Helps in identifying whether particular area is ﬂooded or unﬂooded using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images of that area.

First read about SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar
